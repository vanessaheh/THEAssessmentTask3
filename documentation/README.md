**PURPOSE:**  
The purpose of this project is to examine whether there is a link between adolescents' engagement with lootbox games and the development of future gambling behaviours. By transforming raw data collected from students at Gosford High into valuable insights, I aim to explore the impact of these video games on younger, more impressionable audiences.

**USAGE GUIDE**  
To interact with the program, the user must enter numeric options through the terminal. Anything besides the valid options prints an error message.
